# SVG Logo Maker

## Description

THis projects goal was to create an Object Oreinted program utilizng node and also testing with jest to create a logo for anyone. By running this applicaiton anyone can create a 3 chracter logo in any custom colors for letter and the background of the shape with a choice of 3 shapes (Sqaure, Triangle, and Circle). This application wasn't technically new to me but there werre a few concepts like the shape.js fiule that i haven't really incorporated before so that was fun to learn. Testing was another concept I have never practiced on my own and this was easy due to the cimplicity of the product developed., But a great start.

## Installation

TO install this, install an IDE (I use VSCODE). This will allow you to have the code to run in your terminal. Next open your integrated terminal and run the npm install function (npm i). This will install all of your dependencies. Next go ahead and run 'npm install --save-dev jest' this will allow you to run tests as needed on the code. If you want to test you can use the tests i created in the lib folder with shape.test.js. If you just want to run the code please just utlize node and type 'node index' and follow the prompts.

## Usage

When you follow the prompts for questions you hen will be presented with an svg file named 'logo.svg in the lib folder in the inputs folder' then you can see your logo. Ensure you have the svg extension installed with your IDE to preview the logo easily. If you want to try a different logo out just run the node command again and you can reset your answers.
